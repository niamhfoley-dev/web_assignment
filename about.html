    <h1>About EqualTickets</h1>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At EqualTickets, we believe in fairness, transparency, and accessibility in ticketing. Our mission is to create a
      marketplace where fans can buy and sell resale tickets for comedy, music, and sports events at prices that reflect
      the true value of the experience, not the whims of scalpers and bots.

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>

      industry. We understand the joy of attending live events and the disappointment that comes when tickets are priced
      out of reach. That’s why we created EqualTickets – to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to enjoy their
      favorite performances and games.
